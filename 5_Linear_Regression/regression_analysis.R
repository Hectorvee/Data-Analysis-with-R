## Regression Analysis

# Overview
# Regression analysis is a statistical technique that models and estimates the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely used for:
# - Estimating Relationships: Understanding how the dependent variable changes with variations in the independent variables.
# - Predictions: Obtaining point estimates and confidence intervals for predictions.
# - Analyzing Multiple Variables: Using techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and polynomial regression.

# Key Concepts
# - Dependent Variable (Y): The output or effect that we are trying to predict or explain.
# - Independent Variable (X): The input or cause that influences the dependent variable.

# Regression Model
# The general form of a regression model is:
# Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ... + βkXk + ε
# where:
# - Y is the dependent variable.
# - X1, X2, ..., Xk are the independent variables.
# - β0, β1, β2, ..., βk are the unknown parameters.
# - ε is the error term.

# Estimation of Parameters
# The unknown parameters (β) are estimated using the least squares method, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values.

# Types of Regression
# 1. Linear Regression: Models the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.
# 2. Logistic Regression: Used when the dependent variable is categorical, often binary.
# 3. Ridge Regression: A technique for analyzing multiple regression data that suffer from multicollinearity.
# 4. Lasso Regression: Similar to ridge regression but includes a penalty that can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting a simpler model.
# 5. Polynomial Regression: Models the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables as an nth degree polynomial.

# Important Terms
# - Constants: Fixed values in the regression equation.
# - N: Number of independent measurements.
# - k: Number of unknown parameters.

# Applications
# - Predictive Modeling: Forecasting future trends based on historical data.
# - Risk Management: Assessing the impact of various risk factors.
# - Optimization: Finding the best parameters to maximize or minimize a certain outcome.

# Example: Linear Regression
# In this example, we will use the airquality dataset to predict the ozone concentration based on temperature.
