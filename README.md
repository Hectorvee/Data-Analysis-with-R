# Data Analysis with R

Welcome to the **Data Analysis with R** repository! This repository contains R projects and scripts completed during the **Mathematical Statistics** courses at the **University of Johannesburg**. The focus is on various aspects of data analysis, including sampling techniques, distribution fitting, parametric assumptions, sample comparison methods, and linear regression. Each section provides practical examples and explanations to support learning and mastery of key data analysis concepts.

## Repository Structure

1. **[Sampling, Sample Size Calculation, and Sampling Distribution](./1_Sampling_Sample_Size_Calculation_and_Sampling_Distribution/)**  
   - Discover methods for sampling, determining sample size, and understanding sampling distributions.

2. **[Fitting Distributions](./2_Fitting_Distributions/)**  
   - Learn how to fit various distributions to your data.

3. **[Checking Parametric Assumptions](./3_Checking_Parametric_Assumptions/)**  
   - Understand how to check for parametric assumptions in your data analysis.

4. **[Comparing Samples (Parametric and Non-Parametric)](./4_Comparing_Samples_Parametric_and_Non_Parametric/)**  
   - Compare different samples using both parametric and non-parametric methods.

5. **[Linear Regression](./5_Linear_Regression/)**  
    - Learn the fundamentals of linear regression analysis.
